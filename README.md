# 🎵 Music Web App – RESTful & GraphQL Comparison

This project demonstrates a **full-stack music web application** implemented in **Flask**, showcasing two different API designs:

- **RESTful API**  
- **GraphQL API**  

The goal is to **compare REST and GraphQL approaches** in handling music data, including songs, artists, and playlists. The app allows users to explore how the same data can be fetched, updated, and displayed using different backend strategies.

---

## 📝 Overview

Key features and concepts:

- Dynamic web pages using Flask templates  
- Backend interaction with both RESTful and GraphQL endpoints  
- CRUD operations for songs, artists, and playlists  
- Performance and usability comparison between REST and GraphQL  
- Example datasets included for testing  
- Focus on understanding API design patterns in a real application
