This is the second version of my Flask project. It includes sign-up and sign-in pages and uses Flask-SQLAlchemy to manage the database.
Users can log in, write notes, log out, and when they log back in, their notes will still be there.

Problems I didn't fix yet are 
  1.Errors when intializing the server and it is empty. You should sign up first other wise it makes error
  2.The Naviagtion bar at each page should be different. 
  3.I havn't checked for duplicate emails as well in the sign up
  4.Security Issue: Plain Text Passwords. Never store passwords as plain text.
